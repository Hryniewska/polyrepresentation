## Key Features

üîó **Polyrepresentation Concept:** Explore the innovative concept of polyrepresentation, which seamlessly combines multiple representations from various sources to enhance machine learning performance.

üåê **Transferability:** Discover how the created polyrepresentation can be effectively transferred to smaller datasets, demonstrating its potential as a practical and efficient solution for various image-related tasks.

üî¨ **Multi-Faceted Approach:** Address classification problems comprehensively by leveraging multiple representations, including vector embeddings, self-supervised learning, and radiomic features.

üìà **Performance Boost:** Learn how polyrepresentation consistently outperforms single-model approaches, leading to improved results across different tasks and datasets.

üåç **Versatility:** While initially applied to X-ray images, polyrepresentation's versatility makes it adaptable to diverse domains, offering a novel perspective on data representation.
